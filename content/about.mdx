  Hi, I'm Lara Gabathuler, a young, passionate graphic designer based in
  Switzerland. I enjoy exploring new aspects of life and I’m always up for a
  journey. I’m a sporty person, play soccer and like the special mix of teamwork
  and creativity that comes with it. Great design, functionality, aesthetics and
  quality are goals I always want to reach in new projects.

  <br />


  Have fun and enjoy looking at my work:)

  <br />


  Feel free to drop me a message if you have any further questions or would just like to say hello!

  <br />
