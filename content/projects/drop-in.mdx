  *Drop In —*

  *Teamwork, Concept, Communication*
  <br />

  *January 2020, GBS St.Gallen*
  <br />

  *Virtual Project*
description: >-
  A company has a lot of useless water and wanted to generate a creative
  solution to use the excess water. Money doesn’t matter. So let’s be creative
  and think outside the box. In teamwork, we created the concept of a shower
  box. Located in multiples Swiss cities you can drop in for an unforgettable
  shower. With different choosable moods a special experience is guaranteed.

  <br />


  We’ve designed the logo, app and advertisement to promote the idea.
