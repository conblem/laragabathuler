  Virtual Project
description: >-
  A company has a lot of useless water and wanted to generate a creative
  solution to use the excess water. Money doesn’t matter. So let’s be creative
  and think outside the box. In teamwork, we created the concept of a shower
  box. Located in diverse Swiss cities, you can drop in for an unforgettable
  shower. With different worlds you can choose in the box a special moment is
  guaranteed.

  <br />


  We created an App to book and locate de boxes also the advertisement to promote the idea.
