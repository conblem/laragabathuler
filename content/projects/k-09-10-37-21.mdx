  *Virtual Project*
description: >-
  Kaleidocope, a magazine released twice a year, is a meeting place for a global
  community of creative minds. The task was to create a book for the celebration
  of the tenth anniversary of Kaleidoscope. Creating a new concept without any
  structural limitations.

  <br />


  The translation of time has formed the concept of the book. The timeline as reflection and documentation built the base structure of the layout. The images are placed free to give the designers the space they deserve. Also the content defines the visual look of the book through the formats and the relations of the existing images and texts.

  <br />


  A reflective cover as an interpretation of review and beginning supports the concept of time.
