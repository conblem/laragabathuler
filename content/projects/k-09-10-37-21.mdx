  Kaleidocope a magazine released twice a year, is a meeting place for a global
  community of creative minds. The task was to create a book for the celebration
  of the ten year existing of Kaleidoscope. Creating a new concept for the book
  that hasn’t any structural limitations. \

  <br />


  The translation of time has formed the concept of the book. The timeline as reflection and documentation build the base structure of the layout. The images are placed free to let the designers the space they deserve. Also the content builds the visual look of the book with the formats and the relationship of the existing images and texts.\

  <br />


  A reflective cover as interpretation of the review and the beginning supports the concept of time.
