  *Virtual Project*
description: >-
  Creating a narrative, that’s fixed in measurements and binding but filled with
  variable contents, was the task of this project. My decision fell on the Swiss
  glaciers. The climate change  is a danger for all glaciers. It’s crazy what we
  have already lost of the glaciers. I wanted to give this important theme a
  platform.

  <br />


  To create depths I show the loss and the decline in the past years and in contrast the beauty of the Swiss glaciers. Also defined by the lecturer was the monochrome color. My decision was to increase the dramatic with a huge contrast of black and white. The impact of the pictures is most beautiful and effective in these colors.
