  *Corporade Identity*
  <br />

  *April 2021, GBS St.Gallen*
  <br />

  *Virtual Project*
description: >-
  The gallery stamp is based in Basel, Switzerland. The assignment was to create
  a new identity for the gallery.

  <br />


  A gallery gives artists space where they can show their work. The aspect of the space has built my concept for the new identity. My Idea builds up from the room shown as abstract lines. The art is in the focus. The line who build the room also stand for the support of the gallery, without taking any attention from the artworks.
