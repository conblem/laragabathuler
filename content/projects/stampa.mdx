  *Corporade Identity*
  <br />

  *April 2021, GBS St.Gallen*
  <br />

  *Virtual Project*
description: >-
  The gallery stampa is based in Basel, Switzerland. The assignment was to
  create a new corporate identity for the gallery.

  <br />


  A gallery gives artists space where they can present their work. The aspect of the space has defined my concept for the new identity. My idea builds up from the room shown as abstract lines. The art is in the focus. The line who creates the room is also standing for the support of the gallery without taking any attention from the artworks.
