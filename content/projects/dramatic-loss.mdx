  *December 2020, GBS St.Gallen*
  <br />

  *Virtual Project*
description: >-
  Creating a narrative, that’s fixed in measurements and binding but filled with
  variable contents, was the task of this project. My decision, the Swiss
  glaciers. The climate change  is a danger for all glaciers. It’s crazy what we
  have already lost of the glaciers. I wanted to give this important theme a
  platform.\

  <br />


  To create depths on one side I show the loss and the decline in the past years. In contrast, the beauty of the Swiss glacier. Also defined by the lecturer, the monochrome color. My decision was to increase the dramatic with a huge contrast of black and white, also the picture are most beautiful and effective in these colors.\
