  Chairs, once reserved for royalty, are now an essential part of our daily
  lives. In this project, I explore the design, construction, and functionality
  of seating furniture. The design process unfolds in five stages: research,
  analysis, concept development, drafting, and execution. Key aspects of the
  project include the relationship between people and objects, as well as a
  focus on material usage and craftsmanship.\

  <br />


  This project focuses on designing a chair that will create a cozy and functional space in my room for reading, enjoying coffee, and relaxing. The goal is to create a comfortable, inviting armchair that can be used in different sitting positions, offering ample space for lounging. The use of light wood in the construction will help balance the solid form of the chair, giving it a sense of lightness. The seat will feature a delicately woven surface, creating a contrast that adds visual interest.
