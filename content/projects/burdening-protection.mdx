description: Protecting ourselves is evolutionarily anchored in us. Our
  psychological defence mechanism helps us to better process and overcome
  situations and experiences, but there are still events that cannot be overcome
  so easily. Out of self-protection, we start to repress and build up an
  invisible protective shell. Protection that can be both helpful and a
  hindrance. If the experience remains unprocessed, the initially helpful
  protection changes into a false sense of security. This increasing
  constriction is visualised by layers of protection that build up to the point
  of almost total immobility. The resulting paralysis provides an impetus to
  reflect on when protection can be useful or a burden.
