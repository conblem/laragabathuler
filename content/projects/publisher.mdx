  Publisher is a magazin that publicate one cover per year which is designed by
  students. Its part of a contest, the Canon graphic art award.
  <br />

  The task was to design a cover with the theme «let’s push things forward». My interpretation for the cover includes diverse ways to push things forward. In the meaning of does’nt matter how, just do something to reach your goals. Finally visualised the impact of the actions in different colors and forms to complete the idea for the cover.
