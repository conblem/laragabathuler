  Publisher is a magazine that releases once a year a cover designed by
  students. Its part of a contest called «Canon graphic art award».

  <br />


  The task was to design a cover with the theme «let’s push things forward». My interpretation for the cover includes different ways to push things forward. In the meaning of doesn’t matter how, just do something to reach your goals. In the end I visualized the impact of the actions in different colors and forms to complete the idea.
